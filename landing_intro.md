# Introduction

```{warning}
This book is a work in progress.
```

Having pursued interdisciplinary studies throughout my undergratuate and master's degrees, I decided to write a virtual book (or maybe more like "lecture notes") containing both asset pricing models from financial economics, and Bayesian approaches to some of the common problems in statistics/data science. More than that, I also seek to provide practical implementations in Python and its libraries, such as numpy, pandas, statsmodels, PyMC and more. 

The target audience of this book are statisticians/data scientists who want to learn more about financial economics and asset pricing models, economists who want to learn more about applied statistics (mainly Bayesian methods), and students/professionals of both areas who want to improve Python skills and see practical implementations of those mentioned themes.

The structure of this book is the following: each chapter is divided in 3 sections, where the first introduces topics in financial economics, the second introduces topics in statistical and Bayesian modeling, and the third shows practical examples of Bayesian modeling techniques applied to asset pricing models.

The main inspiration for this book, and what sparked my interest for Bayesian stats when I was an economics undegrad, was Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking", which I think is a spectacular introduction to Bayesian thinking and the "new school" of [Bayesian data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808). I highly recommend it to applied researchers of any area.

## Goals of this work

This virtual book is not meant to contain a throrough theoretical approach of each of the topics mentioned, and, for that purpose, references will be given at the end of each chapter. The goal of the book is to give a hands-on introduction to each of the topics, specifically financial economics theory for people with a stats/data science background, and statistical modeling for people with an economics background. The intent is to "bridge" the knowledge between both fields, and show practical examples of Bayesian modeling for asset pricing models. Another important goal is to show how to implement those models in Python language, specially with statistical libraries such as PyMC and statsmodels. 

## Future steps

This book is a work in progress, meaning that the book content might be updated in the future. Material for a Chapter 4 is already under way. Subjects for additional future chapters might also be considered. Any corrections/suggestions/comments regarding the book are greatly appreciated and can be sent to me at thomascsmartins@gmail.com
